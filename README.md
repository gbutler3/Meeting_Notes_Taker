## Task

Modify the starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end has already been created. Build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Case

As a busy individual, I want to write and save notes so that I can organize and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance Criteria

- When the Note Taker is opened, users are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- When the link to the notes page is clicked, users are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- When a new note title and the note’s text is entered, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
- When the Save icon is clicked, the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
- When existing note in the list in the left-hand column is clicked that specific note appears in the right-hand column
- When users click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
